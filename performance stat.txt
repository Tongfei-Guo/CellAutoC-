Commit 58cb495: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.143s
Commit f6ff46d: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.241s // runtime adding state take too much time?
Commit 3be72e7: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.148s
Commit 7cc931e: 100 iterations, run 10 times, average time 0.150s, because make_unique<Cell>() allocates dynamic memory contiguously if that's my only program 
running, in case of multiple program running, this could fail, and if that cause no memory locality, the performance would be 0.298s.
