**Acknowledgements:** <br />
1. to `CellAuto.js` for the idea of this project <br />
2. to Prof. Bjarne Stroustrup for his invaluable instructions. <br />
3. to TAs Kai-Zhan Lee and Abhishek Shah for their suggestions. <br />

**Documentations:**
1. Refer to CellAutoCpp Tutorial.pdf for instructions on how to use this library.
2. Refer to CellAutoCpp Documentation.pdf for detailed description on each of the APIs.
3. Refer to CellAutoCpp Report.pdf for report of this project.

**How to use:**
1. Download all `.cpp` and `.h` file from Source
2. Include header `CellAutoCpp.h` for no visualization version. Compile with `-std=c++14` flag and link with `-lpthread` option.
3. with visualization version.

**Simple Visualization in Console:**

Our library provides a way of visualization in console. Cellular Automata is displayed at certain frequency by mapping cells with specific states to corresponding ASCII characters. To use it, include `CAConsoleViz.h` in your project as well.

In "ConsoleViz_demo" folder, we provide some example codes of visualization, together with a makefile. Use `make release` or `make debug` to compile these files and use `make clean` to erase the generated object files and executables. All executables are stored under the folder of `exe/`.
